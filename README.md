Belief Agency Code Challenge
==============

##The Goal
The City of Seattle wants to create a marketing site for the neighborhoods of Seattle. Their main goal is to motivate people to signup for a newsletter and help build their user base. We are also working on a video to encourage engagement, and want to use youtube to host the video.

For the purposes of this project, feel free to use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92ISlO9U-84

We've analyzed their analytics and noted that the majority of people are using laptops and encouraging support for the past three versions (including IE 10). Furthermore, the website should be responsive for Android, iOS and Windows phones.

###The Task
Using HTML5 and CSS3 tools, we want to see how you would implement the designs in the PDF/PSD files for the client.

You are welcome to use any development tools, and are encouraged to use node, css and twig templates to render the static site. Please give us any frameworks or 3rd party plugins used and a short reason for your choices.

###Enhancements
On top of the responsive site, we welcome UX implementation for AJAX pagination of neighborhoods, hide/show abilities and using youtube API to show a custom image in place of a youtube video on desktop.

###Honesty
We are not asking you to finish this within a deadline, but want to know how long this took to create. There is often a quick turn around for mockups and presentations but, more importantly, we would also like to know from the outset what your expected time commitment would be from start to finish.

Please create a separate public repo in Github and share your solution with us at hello@beliefagency.com


Thank you and we look forward to your submission!
