Belief Code Challenge
==============

##The Goal
City of Seattle wants to create a marketing site for the neighborhoods of Seattle. Their main goal is to get people to sign signup for a newsletter and help build their user base. We are also working on a video to encourage engagement, and want to use youtube to host the video.

For the purposes of this project, feel free to use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92ISlO9U-84

We've analyzed their analytics and noted that the majority of people are using laptops and encouraging support for the past three versions (including IE 10). Furthermore, the website should be responsive for Android, iOS and Windows phones.

###The Task
Using HTML5 and CSS3 tools, we want to see how you would implement the designs in the PDF/PSD files for the client.

You are welcome to use any development tools, and would encourage using node, scss and twig templates to render the static site. Please give us any frameworks or 3rd party plugins used and a short reason for your choices.

###Enhancements
On top of the responsive site, we welcome UX implementation for AJAX pagination of neighborhoods, hide show abilities and using youtube API to show a custom image in place of a youtube video on desktop.

###Honesty
We are not asking to finish this in a deadline, but want to know how long this took to create. There is often a quick turn around for mockups and presentations, but more importantly is the knowledge of how much time you can commit before something is finished without having started.

Please create a separate public repo in Github and share your solution with us at hello@beliefagency.com

Thank you and we look forward to your submission!
